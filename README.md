## Thoughts on this Project
I really enjoyed learning and working with Angular. Once I got past the learning
curve with Angular, I really enjoyed building this app and found working with Angular
was very straight forward. Also, the online documentation for Angular was a great
resource and helped explain concepts that helped me complete this project.
